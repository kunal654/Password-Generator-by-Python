# Random Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user preferences for length and character types.

## Features

- **Customizable Password**: Users can specify the length of the password and choose to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, and special characters.
- **Secure Password Generation**: The script utilizes the `random` module to generate passwords with high randomness.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Users are prompted to input their preferences for password length and character types in a user-friendly manner.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter (Python 3.x):
   ```
   python random_password_generator.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to specify the desired length of the password and choose the types of characters to include.
3. The script will then generate and display the random password based on the specified criteria.

## Example

Include lowercase letters? (yes/no): yes
Include uppercase letters? (yes/no): yes
Include digits? (yes/no): yes
